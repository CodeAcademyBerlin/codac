## Testing Guidelines

- Write tests for all critical business logic and server actions
- Use Jest and React Testing Library for component testing
- Implement integration tests for complex user workflows
- Test error handling and edge cases thoroughly
- Use proper mocking for external dependencies and APIs
- Test accessibility features and keyboard navigation
- Implement visual regression testing for UI components
- Use proper test data and factories for consistent testing
- Test responsive design and mobile functionality
- Implement end-to-end tests for critical user journeys
- Test database operations and data integrity
- Use proper setup and teardown for test environments
- Test performance characteristics of critical operations
- Implement proper test coverage reporting
- Use descriptive test names and clear assertions
- Test both happy path and error scenarios
- Implement proper async testing patterns
- Test user interactions and form submissions
- Use proper component testing isolation
- Maintain test data separate from production data
- Use Playwright MCP tools for enhanced test automation and debugging
- Leverage MCP for intelligent test generation and maintenance
- Integrate MCP tools for cross-browser testing consistency
